## User Interface Guidelines
- **Never expose vendor names in user-facing messages**: Do not mention third-party service names like "Retell", "SignalWire", "OpenAI", etc. in error messages, success messages, or any UI text visible to end users
- Use product-centric language: "Pat AI assistant", "your number", "activate", "deactivate"
- Keep technical implementation details in backend logs only
