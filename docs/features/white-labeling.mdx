## Overview

White labeling lets you present Solo Mobile as your own product. Replace our branding with yours - your logo, your colors, your domain. Perfect for agencies, resellers, and businesses that want a seamless branded experience for their clients.

<Note>
White labeling is included by default on all plans. No additional setup required.

## White Label for Agencies

### Client Experience

When you white label, your clients see:
- Your logo on login page
- Your colors throughout
- Your product name in browser
- Your support email for help
- No mention of "Solo Mobile"

### Per-Client Customization

Create unique experiences for each client:

**Option 1: Shared Branding**
- All clients see your agency branding
- Single white label configuration
- Simplest setup

**Option 2: Client-Specific Branding**
- Each client organization has its own branding
- Separate logos and colors per client
- Requires separate organization per client

### Reseller Setup

For true resale:
1. Create organization for each client
2. Apply their branding to their organization
3. Invite them with Member or Admin role
4. They never see your agency branding

## What Cannot Be Customized

Some elements remain standard:

- **API domain**: Always `mtxbiyilvgwhbdptysex.supabase.co`
- **Widget domain**: Always `solomobile.ai/widget`
- **Email sender**: Transactional emails from Supabase
- **Mobile app**: Not available for white labeling

## Best Practices

### Brand Consistency

1. **Use vector logos** - SVG scales better than PNG
2. **Match exact colors** - Use your brand style guide
3. **Test on mobile** - Verify branding on small screens
4. **Check dark/light** - Logos should work on both backgrounds

### For Agencies

1. **Create demo account** - Show prospects your branded version
2. **Document for clients** - Explain it's "your" platform
3. **Custom training** - Create guides with your branding
4. **Consistent support** - Route support through your team first

### Domain Setup

1. **Use a subdomain** - `app.yourbrand.com` not `yourbrand.com`
2. **Keep DNS updated** - Don't let the CNAME expire
3. **Plan for email** - Set up SPF/DKIM if sending from your domain

## Verifying White Label

### Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] Logo appears on login page
- [ ] Logo appears in dashboard header
- [ ] Favicon shows in browser tab
- [ ] Primary color applied to buttons
- [ ] Product name in browser title
- [ ] Support email in help section
- [ ] No "Solo Mobile" text visible

### Testing as Client

1. Open incognito/private window
2. Visit your login URL
3. Sign in with a test account
4. Navigate through all sections
5. Verify branding throughout

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing

1. Check file format (SVG or PNG)
2. Verify file size (<5MB)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try a different browser

### Colors Not Applying

1. Ensure valid hex code (e.g., `#FF5722`)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
3. Check for browser extensions affecting CSS

### Custom Domain Not Working

1. Verify DNS CNAME record is set
2. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
3. Check SSL certificate status with support
4. Ensure no conflicting A records

### Widget Still Shows Solo Mobile

The chat widget always loads from `solomobile.ai`. This is required for security and reliability. The widget itself can be styled to match your brand colors.
