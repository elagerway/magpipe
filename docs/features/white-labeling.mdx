## Best Practices

### Logo Design Tips

1. **Use a horizontal layout** - The sidebar space is wide, not tall
2. **Keep it simple** - Detailed logos may be hard to read at small sizes
3. **Use transparent background** - Works better with light and dark themes
4. **Test both themes** - Verify your logo is visible in light and dark mode
5. **Use vector format** - SVG scales better than PNG

### Favicon Design Tips

1. **Keep it recognizable** - Very simple icon that's clear at 16x16px
2. **Use your brand mark** - Just the icon/symbol, not full logo
3. **High contrast** - Make sure it's visible against browser chrome
4. **Square format** - Favicons are always square

### File Optimization

**For logos:**
- Compress PNG files to reduce load time
- SVG is ideal for crisp rendering at any size
- Avoid files over 500KB even though 2MB is allowed

**For favicons:**
- 32x32px is the sweet spot for most browsers
- PNG with transparency works well
- ICO format if you need legacy browser support

## Use Cases

Present Solo Mobile as your own platform to clients:
1. Upload your agency logo

3. Clients see your branding when using the portal

### Businesses

1. Use your company logo
2. Match your other internal tools
3. Reinforce your brand identity

### Resellers

Offer a branded experience to customers:
1. Each customer can set their own logo
2. Their team members see their company branding
3. No mention of Solo Mobile in the interface

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing

1. **Check file size** - Must be under 2MB
2. **Verify format** - PNG, SVG, or JPEG only
3. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R
4. **Try different browser** - Rule out browser-specific issues

### Logo Looks Blurry

1. **Use higher resolution** - At least 400x100px for retina displays
2. **Try SVG format** - Vector graphics never get blurry
3. **Check original file** - Ensure source image is high quality

### Favicon Not Updating

1. **Clear browser cache** - Favicons are heavily cached
2. **Close and reopen tab** - Sometimes required for update
3. **Check file format** - PNG or ICO only
4. **Verify file size** - Must be under 500KB

### Logo Too Large/Small

The logo container is fixed at 160x40px. If your logo appears:
- **Too small**: Use a logo designed for horizontal space
- **Cut off**: Ensure your logo fits within 200x50px recommended size
- **Stretched**: Maintain original aspect ratio in your source file
