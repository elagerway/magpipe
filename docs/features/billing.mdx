Magpipe uses a simple credits-based billing system. You purchase credits and they're automatically deducted as you use the platform. No complex subscriptions or hidden fees.

## How Credits Work

Credits are measured in dollars. When you make calls or send SMS, the cost is deducted from your balance in real-time.

### What Uses Credits

| Feature | Cost |
|---------|------|
| **Voice Calls** | $0.09-0.15/minute (varies by voice + AI model) |
| **SMS Messages** | $0.001/message |

### Voice Call Pricing Breakdown

Voice calls have three cost components:

| Component | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| **Voice (ElevenLabs)** | $0.07/minute |
| **Voice (OpenAI)** | $0.08/minute |
| **Telephony (PSTN)** | $0.015/minute |
| **AI Model** | Varies (see below) |

**AI Model Rates (per minute):**

| Model | Rate |
|-------|------|
| GPT-4o | $0.05 |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.006 |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $0.05 |
| Claude 3 Haiku | $0.006 |

<Info>
**Example**: A 5-minute call using ElevenLabs voice + GPT-4o-mini costs approximately $0.46
- Voice: 5 × $0.07 = $0.35
- AI: 5 × $0.006 = $0.03
- Telephony: 5 × $0.015 = $0.075
</Info>

## Getting Started

### Welcome Bonus

New users receive a **$20 welcome bonus** when they add a payment method. This gives you enough credits to test the platform extensively.

To claim your bonus:
1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **Add Payment Method**
3. Complete the Stripe checkout
4. Your $20 bonus is automatically credited

### Adding Credits

You can add credits at any time from the Billing tab:

**Quick Add Options:**
- $20
- $50
- $100

**Custom Amount:** Enter any amount between $10 and $1,000.

Credits are added instantly after payment completes.

## Auto-Recharge

Never run out of credits mid-call. Auto-recharge automatically tops up your balance when it falls below a threshold.

### How It Works

1. Set a **threshold** (e.g., $5)
2. Set a **recharge amount** (e.g., $50)
3. When your balance drops below $5, we automatically charge your card for $50

<Warning>
Auto-recharge uses your saved payment method. If the charge fails (e.g., expired card), auto-recharge is disabled until you update your payment method.
</Warning>

### Enabling Auto-Recharge

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Toggle **Auto-Recharge** on
3. Set your preferred threshold and amount

Auto-recharge is automatically enabled when you claim your welcome bonus.
