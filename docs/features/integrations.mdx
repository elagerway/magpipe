## Overview

Integrations extend what your AI agents can do. Connect to your CRM, calendar, helpdesk, and more. When a caller asks to book an appointment, your agent checks your actual calendar. When a lead calls, their info is logged directly to your CRM.

Solo Mobile uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for integrations, giving you access to 40+ pre-built connections plus the ability to add custom integrations.

## How Integrations Work

### Tool-Based Architecture

Each integration provides "tools" that agents can use:

```
Caller: "I'd like to book an appointment for next Tuesday at 2 PM"
          ↓
Agent uses calendar_check_availability tool
          ↓
Cal.com returns: Tuesday 2 PM is available
          ↓
Agent uses calendar_create_booking tool
          ↓
Cal.com creates the appointment
          ↓
Agent: "I've booked you for Tuesday at 2 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email."
```

### Automatic Tool Selection

Agents automatically choose the right tool based on context. You don't need to configure when to use each tool - the AI determines this naturally from the conversation.

### Adding an MCP Server

1. Go to **Apps** in the main navigation
2. Click **+ Add MCP Server**
3. Enter server details:
   - **Name** - Display name
   - **URL** - Server endpoint
   - **Authentication** - API key or OAuth
4. Click **Test Connection**
5. Save if successful

### Custom MCP Servers

Build your own MCP server for custom integrations:

1. Implement the MCP specification
2. Host your server (cloud function, VPS, etc.)
3. Add the URL to Solo Mobile
4. Your tools become available to agents

See [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for implementation details.

## Per-Agent Configuration

### Enabling Integrations

Not all agents need all integrations. Configure per-agent:

1. Open the agent you want to configure
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Find the **Integrations** section
4. Toggle integrations on/off

### Tool Permissions

Control which tools each agent can use:

- **Calendar**: Read-only vs. Read/Write
- **CRM**: Search only vs. Create/Update
- **Communication**: Notify only vs. Send messages

### Prompt Guidance

Help agents use integrations effectively by adding instructions to your system prompt:

```
INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- When a caller wants to book, use Cal.com to check availability
- Always offer at least 3 available time slots
- Log all new callers to HubSpot as leads
- For urgent issues, alert the team in #support Slack channel
```

## Data & Privacy

### What Data is Shared

When you connect an integration:
- Solo Mobile receives OAuth tokens or API keys
- Agents can access data within granted scopes
- Call context may be sent to integrations (e.g., contact lookup)

### What Data is NOT Shared

- Call recordings are not sent to integrations
- Full transcripts are not shared
- Personal notes are kept private

### Disconnecting

To revoke access:
1. Go to **Apps**
2. Find the integration
3. Click **Disconnect**
4. Confirm

This immediately revokes Solo Mobile's access. You may also want to revoke in the third-party service's settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Working

1. **Check connection status** - Go to Apps, verify "Connected"
2. **Check permissions** - Ensure sufficient scopes granted
3. **Check agent settings** - Verify integration enabled for agent
4. **Check tool usage** - Review call transcript for tool calls

### Authentication Errors

- OAuth tokens can expire - reconnect the integration
- API keys may be revoked - check in third-party service
- Scopes may have changed - re-authorize with updated permissions

### Slow Responses

Integration calls add latency:
- Simple lookups: +200-500ms
- Complex queries: +1-2 seconds
- Database writes: +500ms-1s

Consider this when multiple integrations are active.

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

1. Begin with 1-2 key integrations
2. Test thoroughly with real calls
3. Add more as needed

### Security

- Only connect integrations you actively need
- Use least-privilege permissions
- Regularly audit connected apps
- Disconnect unused integrations

### Agent Instructions

- Be explicit about when to use integrations
- Provide fallback instructions if integration fails
- Set expectations ("I'll check the calendar...")
