2. Click **Generate New Key**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Server")
4. Copy the full key immediately — it is only shown once

<Warning>
The full API key is only displayed at creation time. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
</Warning>

**Managing keys:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Descriptive label you assigned |
| **Key** | First 8 characters (`mgp_...`) for identification |
| **Created** | When the key was generated |
| **Last Used** | When the key was last used in an API request |
| **Actions** | Revoke button to permanently disable the key |

**Limits:** Maximum 10 active API keys per account.

**Using a key:** Include it as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.magpipe.ai/functions/v1/list-agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mgp_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```
