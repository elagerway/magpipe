## Overview

Team Management lets you collaborate with others on your AI phone system. Create an organization, invite team members, and assign roles to control who can do what. Perfect for agencies managing multiple clients, businesses with support teams, or anyone who needs multiple people accessing the dashboard.

## Agency & Reseller Use Cases

### Managing Multiple Clients

For agencies managing multiple businesses:

**Option 1: Separate Organizations**
- Create one organization per client
- Invite client as Member (view only) or Admin
- You maintain Owner access for management

**Option 2: Single Organization**
- One organization with multiple agents
- Each agent represents a client's business
- Team members see all agents

### Client Access Levels

Recommended role assignments:

| Client Type | Recommended Role |
|-------------|------------------|
| Hands-off client | No access (you manage everything) |
| View-only client | Member |
| Self-service client | Admin |
| Full control client | Owner (you become Admin) |

### White Label + Teams

Combine with [White Labeling](/features/white-labeling) for a complete agency setup:
- Custom branding on their login
- Your logo and colors
- Client sees their own dashboard
- No "Magpipe" branding

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Use least privilege**: Give members only the access they need
2. **Regular audits**: Review team members quarterly
3. **Remove promptly**: Remove access when someone leaves
4. **Protect Owner account**: Use strong password and 2FA

### Organization Structure

1. **One org per business**: Don't mix unrelated businesses
2. **Clear naming**: Use descriptive organization names
3. **Document roles**: Keep internal notes on who does what
4. **Single Owner**: Have one clear Owner for accountability

### Onboarding New Members

1. **Send invitation** with context about the role
2. **Provide documentation** on how to use the system
3. **Start with limited access** (Member role)
4. **Upgrade as needed** based on responsibilities

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Received

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Resend the invitation
4. Try a different email address

### Cannot Access Resources

If a team member cannot access expected resources:
1. Verify they accepted the invitation
2. Check their assigned role
3. Confirm they're in the correct organization
4. Check if the resource exists (agent, number, etc.)

### Multiple Organizations

Users can belong to multiple organizations:
- Switch between orgs in the account menu
- Each org has separate resources
- Roles are independent per organization
