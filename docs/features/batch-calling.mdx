---

Batch Calling lets you create large-scale outbound call campaigns using your AI agents. Upload a CSV of recipients, configure scheduling and concurrency, then let your agents handle each conversation.

## Overview

Batch Calling provides enterprise-grade outbound calling capabilities:

- **CSV Upload** - Upload recipients via CSV file with a downloadable template
- **Scheduling** - Send now or schedule for a specific date and time
- **Call Windows** - Restrict calls to specific hours and days of the week
- **Concurrency** - Control how many calls run simultaneously
- **Draft & History** - Save drafts and track all batch campaigns

### Use Cases

- **Appointment reminders** - Call patients/clients about upcoming appointments
- **Follow-up campaigns** - Reach out to leads after an event or inquiry
- **Survey calls** - Collect feedback from customers at scale
- **Notification calls** - Inform contacts about important updates
- **Outreach campaigns** - Introduce new products or services

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Batch

Navigate to **Batch Calls** in the sidebar to access the feature.

Fill in the batch configuration:
- **Batch Call Name** - A descriptive name for your campaign
- **From Number** - Select which Magpipe phone number to call from (shows associated agent)

### 2. Upload Recipients

Upload a CSV file with your recipient list. Download the template for the correct format:

```csv
name,phone_number
John Doe,+14155551234
Jane Smith,+12125559876
```

The CSV parser automatically detects columns including `name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, `phone_number`, `mobile`, and `cell`.

<Tip>
Phone numbers should be in E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX). Numbers without the + prefix will be auto-formatted.
</Tip>

### 3. Configure Scheduling

- **Send Now** - Calls begin immediately after creation
- **Schedule** - Pick a specific date and time to start the campaign

### 4. Set Call Window

Control when calls can be made:
- **Time Range** - e.g., 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
- **Days** - Select which days of the week (default: Monday-Friday)

Calls outside the window are automatically paused and resume when the window reopens.

### 5. Concurrency Settings

- **Reserved Concurrency** - Slots reserved for inbound and other calls
- **Batch Concurrency** - Remaining slots allocated to batch calling

### 6. Send or Save Draft

- **Save as Draft** - Save your batch to edit and send later
- **Send** - Start the campaign (or schedule it)

### 7. Track Results

Switch to the **History** tab to view all batches with:
- Status (draft, scheduled, running, completed, cancelled, failed)
- Completion counts and failure counts
- Click any batch to view individual recipient status updating in real-time
- Re-run completed or failed batches with one click

## Batch Status Flow

```
draft → scheduled → running → completed ↘
                  ↘ paused ↗              → re-run → running
                  ↘ cancelled            ↗
                  ↘ failed              ↗
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Saved but not sent |
| `scheduled` | Scheduled for future execution |
| `running` | Currently making calls |
| `paused` | Temporarily paused (outside call window) |
| `completed` | All recipients processed |
| `cancelled` | Manually cancelled |
| `failed` | Batch encountered a critical error |

## Recipient Status

Each recipient's status updates in real-time as the call progresses:

| Status | UI Label | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `pending` | Pending | Waiting to be called |
| `calling` | Initiating | Call is being placed |
| `initiated` | Initiating | Call initiated with carrier |
| `ringing` | Ringing | Recipient's phone is ringing |
| `in_progress` | Connected | Recipient answered, call in progress |
| `completed` | Hungup | Call completed successfully |
| `failed` | Failed | Call failed to connect |
| `busy` | Busy | Recipient's line was busy |
| `no_answer` | No Answer | Recipient did not answer |
| `skipped` | Skipped | Skipped (batch cancelled) |

## Re-running Batches

Completed, cancelled, or failed batches can be re-run from the History view. Click the **Re-Run** button to reset all recipients back to pending and restart the campaign. This is useful for:

- Retrying failed calls after fixing issues
- Re-running campaigns with updated agent prompts
- Reaching contacts who didn't answer the first time

## API Integration

You can create and manage batch calls programmatically via the API:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.magpipe.ai/functions/v1/batch-calls', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'create',
    name: 'Appointment Reminders - January',
    caller_id: '+16045551234',
    send_now: true,
    window_start_time: '09:00',
    window_end_time: '17:00',
    window_days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    reserved_concurrency: 5,
    recipients: [
      { name: 'John Doe', phone_number: '+14155551234' },
      { name: 'Jane Smith', phone_number: '+12125559876' }
    ]
  })
});
```

## Best Practices

### Contact Preparation

- **Verify phone numbers** - Ensure all numbers are in E.164 format
- **Segment your list** - Group contacts by campaign type
- **Check consent** - Only call contacts who've opted in

### Timing

- **Business hours** - Use call windows to restrict calling hours
- **Time zones** - Consider contact locations when setting windows
- **Scheduling** - Schedule campaigns for optimal pickup rates

### Agent Configuration

<Tip>
Make sure your outbound agent's system prompt includes context about why you're calling and what to achieve. Consider using outbound call templates for consistency.
</Tip>

### Compliance

<Warning>
Ensure your batch calling campaigns comply with local regulations:
- **TCPA** (US) - Requires prior express consent for automated calls
- **Do Not Call** - Respect opt-out requests
- **Local laws** - Check requirements in your jurisdiction
</Warning>
