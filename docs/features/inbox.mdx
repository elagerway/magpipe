## Human Handoff

### Taking Over a Conversation

You can intervene in any conversation at any time:

1. **Open the conversation** from the inbox
2. **Type your message** in the reply box
3. **Click Send** to deliver your response

### What Happens During Handoff

When you send a manual reply:
- Your message is delivered immediately
- AI agent pauses for this conversation
- The 🤖 indicator does NOT appear on your messages
- Customer sees a seamless conversation

### AI Resume Behavior

The AI resumes responding after:
- **5 minutes** of your inactivity in the thread
- Or when you explicitly re-enable AI (toggle)

This prevents the AI from interrupting while you're actively helping.

### Handoff Best Practices

1. **Introduce yourself** (optional): "Hi, this is Sarah taking over..."
2. **Review the transcript** before responding
3. **Check AI summary** for quick context
4. **Resolve the issue** before stepping away
5. **Let AI handle routine follow-ups** after resolution
