description: "Give your AI agents contextual knowledge about your business"

## Overview

The Knowledge Base is your agent's memory. It stores information about your business - FAQs, services, pricing, policies - that agents reference when answering questions. Using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), agents can provide accurate, contextual responses based on your actual content rather than making things up.

## How It Works

### Vector Search Technology

Solo Mobile uses pgvector for semantic search:

1. **Content Ingestion**
   - You add a URL or document
   - Content is fetched and cleaned
   - Text is split into chunks (~500 tokens each)

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
   - Embeddings capture semantic meaning
   - Stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector

3. **Runtime Retrieval**
   - When a caller asks a question
   - Question is converted to an embedding
   - Similar chunks are found via cosine similarity
   - Top 3-5 most relevant chunks are retrieved

4. **Context Injection**
   - Retrieved chunks are added to the agent's context
   - Agent uses this information to answer accurately
   - Responses cite actual content from your knowledge base

### Why RAG?

Without knowledge base:
> "What are your business hours?"
> "I don't have that information." ❌

With knowledge base:
> "What are your business hours?"
> "We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM, and Saturday from 10 AM to 2 PM." ✓

## Adding Knowledge Sources

### From URL

Add content from any public webpage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge">
    Go to **Knowledge** from the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Source">
    Click the **+ Add Source** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter URL">
    Paste the full URL of the webpage to import.
    Example: `https://yoursite.com/faq`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Sync Schedule">
    Choose how often to re-fetch content:
    - Every 24 hours
    - Every 7 days
    - Every month
    - Every 3 months
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **Add Source**. Processing begins immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Protected Pages

For pages behind authentication:

**Bearer Token / API Key:**
1. Check "Requires authentication"
2. Select "Bearer Token"
3. Enter your token: `your-api-key-here`

**Basic Auth:**
1. Check "Requires authentication"
2. Select "Basic Auth"
3. Enter username and password

## Managing Sources

### Source Dashboard

Each knowledge source displays:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Extracted page title or custom name |
| **URL** | Source location |
| **Status** | `syncing`, `completed`, `failed` |
| **Chunks** | Number of text chunks created |
| **Last Synced** | Timestamp of last successful sync |
| **Next Sync** | When automatic re-sync will occur |

### Source Statuses

- **Syncing** - Content is being fetched and processed
- **Completed** - Successfully processed and indexed
- **Failed** - Error occurred (click to see details)

### Editing Sources

Click a source to:
- Change the sync schedule
- Update authentication credentials
- Force an immediate re-sync
- View processing logs

### Deleting Sources

To remove a knowledge source:
1. Click the source to expand
2. Click **Delete Source**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a source removes all associated content immediately. Your agent will no longer have access to this information.
</Warning>

## Content Best Practices

### What to Add

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FAQ Pages" icon="circle-question">
    Your FAQ page is ideal - it contains pre-written Q&A pairs that translate perfectly to agent responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services & Pricing" icon="tags">
    Add pages describing what you offer and pricing. Agents can accurately quote prices and explain services.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="About Us & Company Info" icon="building">
    Include your story, mission, and team info. Agents can answer "tell me about your company" naturally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contact & Location" icon="location-dot">
    Add pages with address, hours, directions, parking info. Critical for "where are you located?" questions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Policies" icon="file-contract">
    Include return policies, cancellation policies, terms. Agents can explain policies accurately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Product Catalogs" icon="box">
    Add product pages. Agents can describe features and specifications to callers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What NOT to Add

- **Entire websites** - Too much noise, dilutes relevance
- **Login-protected portals** - Customer-specific data
- **Frequently changing content** - Will become stale
- **Competitor information** - Could confuse the agent
- **Internal documents** - Security risk

### Content Quality Tips

1. **Keep it factual** - Agents repeat what's in the knowledge base
2. **Use clear language** - Avoid jargon unless your customers use it
3. **Structure with headings** - Helps chunking algorithm
4. **Include common variations** - "hours" and "business hours" both work
5. **Update regularly** - Re-sync when your content changes

## Automatic Sync

### How Sync Works

- At the scheduled interval, Solo Mobile re-fetches your URL
- Content is compared to existing version
- If changed, new chunks are generated
- Old chunks are replaced atomically
- Agent immediately uses new content

### Sync Schedules

| Schedule | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Every 24 hours** | Frequently updated content |
| **Every 7 days** | Weekly-changing information |
| **Every month** | Relatively stable content |
| **Every 3 months** | Static content (policies, about) |

### Manual Re-sync

Force an immediate re-sync:
1. Click the knowledge source
2. Click **Sync Now**
3. Wait for processing to complete

## Agent Integration

### Per-Agent Knowledge

Each agent can access:
- All knowledge sources you've added
- Relevant chunks are retrieved per-question
- No configuration needed - automatic

### Prompt Integration

Knowledge context is automatically injected:

```
[System Prompt - your configuration]

[Knowledge Context]
The following information was retrieved from the knowledge base:

--- From: FAQ Page ---
Q: What are your business hours?
A: We're open Monday-Friday 9 AM to 5 PM, Saturday 10 AM to 2 PM.

--- From: Services Page ---
Our basic plan starts at $29/month and includes...
[End Knowledge Context]

[User Question]
What time do you open on Saturdays?
```

### Knowledge Limitations

- **3-5 chunks** retrieved per question (most relevant)
- **~2000 tokens** max knowledge context per response
- Chunks prioritized by relevance score
- Less relevant chunks truncated if limit exceeded

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Knowledge Usage

Track how your knowledge base is being used:
- Which sources are accessed most
- Common questions by topic
- Retrieval success rate
- Gaps in knowledge (unanswered questions)

### Retrieval Logs

View what knowledge was used in each conversation:
1. Open a conversation in Inbox
2. View the transcript
3. See which knowledge chunks were retrieved

## Limits

| Resource | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Knowledge sources | 50 per account |
| Maximum page size | 1 MB |
| Chunks per source | ~500 |
| Total chunks | 10,000 per account |
| Sync frequency | Minimum 24 hours |

## Troubleshooting

### Source Shows "Failed"

Common causes:
- URL is not accessible
- Page requires JavaScript to render
- Authentication credentials incorrect
- Content exceeds size limit

**Solution:** Click the source to see the error message, fix the issue, and retry.

### Agent Not Using Knowledge

Check:
1. Source status is "completed"
2. Content was successfully chunked (count > 0)
3. Question is related to the content
4. Try asking a direct question from the content

### Outdated Information

If agent gives old information:
1. Check when source last synced
2. Force a manual re-sync
3. Verify the source URL shows current content
