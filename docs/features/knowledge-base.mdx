## Overview

The Knowledge Base stores information that your AI agents can reference when answering questions. Add websites, documents, and custom content to give agents context about your business.

## Adding Knowledge Sources

### From URL

Add content from any public webpage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Knowledge">
    Navigate to **Knowledge** from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Source">
    Click **+ Add Source**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter URL">
    Paste the URL of the webpage to import.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Sync">
    Choose how often to re-sync the content:
    - Every 24 hours
    - Every 7 days
    - Every month
    - Every 3 months
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authentication (Optional)">
    If the page requires login:
    - Check "Requires authentication"
    - Choose auth type (Bearer Token or Basic Auth)
    - Enter credentials
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Protected Pages

For pages that require authentication:

**Bearer Token / API Key:**
```
Bearer your-api-token-here
```

**Basic Auth:**
- Enter username and password
- Credentials are encoded automatically

## How It Works

1. **Fetch** - Solo Mobile retrieves the webpage content
2. **Extract** - Text is extracted and cleaned
3. **Chunk** - Content is split into smaller pieces
4. **Embed** - AI embeddings are generated for semantic search
5. **Store** - Chunks are saved to your knowledge base

When an agent needs information:
1. The question is converted to an embedding
2. Relevant chunks are found via similarity search
3. Context is provided to the agent for answering

## Managing Sources

Each knowledge source shows:
- **Title** - Page title or custom name
- **URL** - Source location
- **Status** - Syncing, completed, or failed
- **Chunks** - Number of content pieces
- **Last Synced** - When content was last updated

### Deleting Sources

Click a source to expand details, then click **Delete** to remove it and all associated content.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add your FAQ page">
    Your FAQ or help center is a great first source - it contains answers to common questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include product/service pages">
    Add pages that describe what you offer so agents can answer "what do you do?" questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add location and hours">
    Include your contact page with address, hours, and directions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep content focused">
    Add specific, relevant pages rather than entire websites. Quality over quantity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limits

- Maximum 50 knowledge sources per account
- Maximum 1MB per page
- Content is automatically chunked for optimal retrieval
