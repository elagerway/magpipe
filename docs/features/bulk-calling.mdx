description: "Make automated AI-powered calls to multiple contacts"
---

Bulk Calling lets you initiate outbound calls to multiple contacts using your AI agent. Each contact is called sequentially, with the agent handling each conversation according to your configuration.

## Overview

Instead of manually initiating calls one by one, Bulk Calling automates outreach to a list of contacts:

- Select contacts from your contact list
- Choose which phone number to call from
- Start the campaign - your agent handles each call
- Track results in your call history

### Use Cases

- **Appointment reminders** - Call patients/clients about upcoming appointments
- **Follow-up campaigns** - Reach out to leads after an event or inquiry
- **Survey calls** - Collect feedback from customers
- **Notification calls** - Inform contacts about important updates
- **Outreach campaigns** - Introduce new products or services

## How It Works

### 1. Select Contacts

Navigate to **Phone → Bulk Calling** to access the feature.

You'll see your contact list with checkboxes:
- Click individual contacts to select them
- Use "Select all" to choose everyone
- Only contacts with valid phone numbers can be selected
- The selected count displays in the top-right

### 2. Choose Caller ID

Select which of your Magpipe phone numbers to call from. The agent assigned to that number will handle all calls in the campaign.

<Tip>
Make sure your agent's system prompt is configured for outbound calls. Consider creating a dedicated outbound agent for bulk campaigns.
</Tip>

### 3. Start Campaign

Click "Start Calling" to begin. Calls are made sequentially:

```
Contact 1 → Call completes → Contact 2 → Call completes → Contact 3 → ...
```

Each call follows the standard outbound call flow:
1. Your agent joins the call
2. The contact's phone rings
3. When answered, the agent handles the conversation
4. Call is recorded and transcribed
5. Next contact is called

### 4. Track Results

All calls appear in your call history with full details:
- Call duration
- Recording and transcript
- AI-generated summary
- Call disposition (answered, voicemail, no answer, etc.)

## Agent Configuration

Your agent should be configured for outbound calling:

### System Prompt Tips

Include context for outbound conversations:

```
You are calling on behalf of [Company Name].

Purpose: [Why you're calling]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]

Start by introducing yourself and confirming you're speaking with the right person.
```

### Call Templates

Use outbound call templates to standardize your campaigns:

1. Go to your agent settings
2. Create a call template with:
   - **Purpose** - Why you're calling (e.g., "appointment reminder")
   - **Goal** - Desired outcome (e.g., "confirm attendance")
3. Select the template when starting bulk calls

## Best Practices

### Contact Preparation

- **Verify phone numbers** - Ensure all numbers are in E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- **Segment your list** - Group contacts by campaign type
- **Check consent** - Only call contacts who've opted in to receive calls

### Timing

- **Business hours** - Schedule calls during appropriate times
- **Time zones** - Consider contact locations
- **Spacing** - Sequential calling naturally spaces out calls

### Compliance

<Warning>
Ensure your bulk calling campaigns comply with local regulations:
- **TCPA** (US) - Requires prior express consent for automated calls
- **Do Not Call** - Respect opt-out requests
- **Local laws** - Check requirements in your jurisdiction
</Warning>

## API Integration

You can also initiate bulk calls programmatically by calling the outbound call endpoint for each contact:

```javascript
const contacts = ['+14155551234', '+14155555678', '+14155559012'];

for (const phone of contacts) {
  await fetch('https://api.magpipe.ai/functions/v1/initiate-bridged-call', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      phone_number: phone,
      caller_id: '+16045559876',  // Your Magpipe number
      purpose: 'Appointment reminder',
      goal: 'Confirm attendance'
    })
  });

  // Wait for call to complete before next
  await waitForCallCompletion();
}
```

See the [Create Call](/api-reference/endpoints/create-call) endpoint for full details.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I pause a bulk calling campaign?">
    Currently, once started, calls proceed sequentially until all contacts are called. To stop, you can navigate away from the page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a contact doesn't answer?">
    The call is logged as "no answer" and the campaign moves to the next contact. Voicemail detection and messages depend on your agent configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I retry failed calls?">
    Failed calls are logged but not automatically retried. You can manually call those contacts later or start a new campaign with just those contacts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I track campaign results?">
    All calls appear in your call history. Filter by date and caller ID to see results from a specific campaign.
