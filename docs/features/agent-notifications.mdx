## Overview

Each agent has its own notification settings. Configure which channels receive alerts for calls and messages, independently per agent. Access notifications from **Agent Detail** → **Notifications** tab.

## Notification Channels

### Email Notifications

Get email alerts for agent activity:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | Master toggle for email notifications |
| **Email Address** | Where to send alerts (defaults to your account email) |
| **Inbound Calls** | Alert on incoming calls |
| **All Calls** | Alert on all calls (inbound + outbound) |
| **Inbound Messages** | Alert on incoming SMS/chat messages |
| **All Messages** | Alert on all messages |

### SMS Notifications

Get text message alerts:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | Master toggle for SMS notifications |
| **Phone Number** | Where to send SMS alerts (defaults to your account phone) |
| **Inbound Calls** | Alert on incoming calls |
| **All Calls** | Alert on all calls |
| **Inbound Messages** | Alert on incoming messages |
| **All Messages** | Alert on all messages |

### Push Notifications

Get instant alerts on your device:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | Master toggle for push notifications |
| **Inbound Calls** | Push alert on incoming calls |
| **All Calls** | Push alert on all calls |
| **Inbound Messages** | Push alert on incoming messages |
| **All Messages** | Push alert on all messages |

<Note>
Push notifications require a modern browser (iOS 16.4+ for Safari) and the app must be installed as a PWA on mobile devices.
</Note>

### App Notifications

Control which connected apps receive data from this agent's conversations. Apps like Slack and HubSpot appear here once connected from the [Apps](/features/apps) page.

Each app card has:
- **Master toggle** — Enable/disable the app for this agent
- **SMS messages** — Send SMS conversation data to the app
- **Call summaries** — Send call summary data to the app
- **Web chat messages** — Send chat widget conversation data to the app
- **Include translations** — Include translated content (when translation is enabled)

## Per-Agent Independence

Each agent maintains its own notification preferences. Changing notifications for one agent does not affect any other agent. This allows you to:

- Get email alerts for your primary agent but not test agents
- Route different agents to different Slack channels
- Enable push notifications only for high-priority agents

## Auto-Save

All notification settings auto-save when changed. A "Saved" indicator confirms the save completed successfully.
