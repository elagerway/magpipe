## Overview

Contacts stores information about people who call, text, chat with, or email your AI agents. Build a database of customers with names, emails, phone numbers, company info, and conversation history. Contacts are created automatically from incoming communications or manually.

### Email Enrichment

When an email arrives from a new sender:
- Contact data is automatically looked up (company, phone, job title, LinkedIn, Twitter)
