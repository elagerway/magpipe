## Overview

Apps extend what your AI agents can do. Connect to your CRM, calendar, helpdesk, and more. When a caller asks to book an appointment, your agent checks your actual calendar. When a lead calls, their info is logged directly to your CRM.

Solo Mobile has two levels of app configuration:
- **Apps** (global) - Connect external services like Cal.com, HubSpot, and Slack
- **Functions** (per-agent) - Enable built-in capabilities like SMS, transfers, and booking

## Connected Apps

Connected Apps are external services that your agents can use. Configure them once in the **Apps** section, then they're available to all your agents.

## MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers let you add custom tools beyond the built-in apps.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard for connecting AI to external tools. Solo Mobile supports any MCP-compatible server, giving you access to 40+ pre-built servers plus the ability to create custom ones.

See [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for implementation details.

## How Apps Work

### Tool-Based Architecture

Each connected app provides "tools" that agents can use:

```
Caller: "I'd like to book an appointment for next Tuesday at 2 PM"
          ↓
Agent uses calendar_check_availability tool
          ↓
Cal.com returns: Tuesday 2 PM is available
          ↓
Agent uses calendar_create_booking tool
          ↓
Cal.com creates the appointment
          ↓
Agent: "I've booked you for Tuesday at 2 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email."
```

### Automatic Tool Selection

Agents automatically choose the right tool based on context. You don't need to configure when to use each tool - the AI determines this naturally from the conversation.

### Prompt Guidance

Help agents use apps effectively by adding instructions to your system prompt:

```
APP INSTRUCTIONS:
- When a caller wants to book, use Cal.com to check availability
- Always offer at least 3 available time slots
- Log all new callers to HubSpot as leads
- For urgent issues, alert the team in #support Slack channel
```

## Data & Privacy

### What Data is Shared

When you connect an app:
- Solo Mobile receives OAuth tokens or API keys
- Agents can access data within granted scopes
- Call context may be sent to apps (e.g., contact lookup)

### What Data is NOT Shared

- Call recordings are not sent to connected apps
- Full transcripts are not shared
- Personal notes are kept private

## Troubleshooting

### App Not Working

1. **Check connection status** - Go to Apps, verify "Connected"
2. **Check permissions** - Ensure sufficient scopes granted
3. **Check agent functions** - Verify function enabled for agent
4. **Check tool usage** - Review call transcript for tool calls

### Authentication Errors

- OAuth tokens can expire - reconnect the app
- API keys may be revoked - check in third-party service
- Scopes may have changed - re-authorize with updated permissions

### Slow Responses

App calls add latency:
- Simple lookups: +200-500ms
- Complex queries: +1-2 seconds
- Database writes: +500ms-1s

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

1. Begin with 1-2 key apps
2. Test thoroughly with real calls
3. Add more as needed

### Security

- Only connect apps you actively need
- Use least-privilege permissions
- Regularly audit connected apps
- Disconnect unused apps

### Agent Instructions

- Be explicit about when to use apps
- Provide fallback instructions if app fails
- Set expectations ("I'll check the calendar...")
