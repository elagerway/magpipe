### Basic Information

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The agent's display name (e.g., "Sarah - Reception") |
| **Greeting** | What the agent says when answering a call |
| **Voice** | The AI voice used for phone calls |

### System Prompt

The system prompt defines your agent's personality, knowledge, and behavior. This is the most important setting for customizing how your agent responds.

**Example system prompt:**
```
You are Sarah, a friendly receptionist for Acme Dental Clinic.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about our services (cleanings, fillings, crowns, whitening)
- Help callers book appointments
- Provide office hours: Monday-Friday 9am-5pm
- Give directions to our location: 123 Main St, Suite 100

Always be warm and professional. If you don't know something, offer to have someone call them back.
```

### Voice Selection

Choose from multiple AI voices with different characteristics:
- Male/Female options
- Various accents and tones
- Professional or casual styles
