## Overview

System Functions are pre-built capabilities available to all AI agents. Unlike [Custom Functions](/features/custom-functions) which call external webhooks, System Functions are built into the platform and handle common tasks like ending calls, transferring to humans, and sending messages.

## Available Functions

### End Call

Allows the agent to hang up when the conversation is complete.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable/Disable** | Toggle whether the agent can end calls |
| **Condition** | Customize when the agent should end the call |

**Default Condition:**
```
End the phone call. Use this when the conversation is complete,
the caller says goodbye, or there is nothing more to discuss.
```

**Custom Condition Examples:**
- "End the call after confirming the appointment and saying goodbye"
- "End the call only after the caller explicitly says goodbye or asks to hang up"
- "End the call after completing the order and providing the confirmation number"

<Note>
When End Call is disabled, calls will only end when the caller hangs up.
</Note>

  <Card title="Clear Conditions" icon="message">
    Write specific end call conditions so your agent knows exactly when to hang up

    Only extract data you'll actually use - too many variables can confuse the AI
