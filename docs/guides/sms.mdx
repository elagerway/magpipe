## Overview

Your Magpipe phone numbers can send and receive SMS text messages. Your AI agent handles incoming texts automatically.

## Receiving SMS

When someone texts your Magpipe number:

1. **Message received** - Text arrives at your number
2. **Agent responds** - AI generates a contextual response
3. **Reply sent** - Response is sent to the sender
4. **Inbox updated** - Conversation appears in your Inbox

The agent uses the same system prompt and knowledge as phone calls, adapted for text format.

## Sending SMS

### From the Inbox

1. Open an existing conversation
2. Type your message in the reply box
3. Tap **Send**

### New Conversation

1. Go to **Inbox**
2. Tap the compose button
3. Enter the recipient's phone number
4. Type your message
5. Tap **Send**

## AI vs Manual Messages

### AI Messages
- Generated automatically when someone texts your number
- Based on agent's system prompt and knowledge
- Marked with "AI" indicator in the conversation

### Manual Messages
- You type and send yourself
- AI pauses for that conversation
- Resume AI by letting it respond to the next inbound message

## Conversation Context

The AI maintains context across messages:

```
Visitor: What are your hours?
Agent: We're open Monday-Friday, 9am to 5pm.

Visitor: Are you open Saturday?
Agent: We're closed on weekends, but you can leave a message and we'll respond Monday morning.

Visitor: Ok thanks
Agent: You're welcome! Have a great day.
```

The agent remembers the conversation flow and responds appropriately.

## SMS Schedule & After-Hours

You can set a separate schedule for SMS responses, independent of your call schedule.

### Configuring SMS Schedule

1. Open the agent settings
2. Go to **Schedule** tab
3. Configure the **Texts Schedule** section with hours for each day
4. Optionally set an **After-Hours SMS Forwarding** number

### After-Hours Behavior

When a text comes in outside your agent's SMS schedule:

**With forwarding number**: The inbound message is forwarded to your after-hours SMS number, and the sender receives: "This Magpipe agent is currently off duty."

**Without forwarding number**: The sender receives: "This Magpipe agent is currently off duty." No AI response is generated.

During scheduled hours, texts are handled normally by the AI agent.

## Multilingual SMS

Your agent's language setting applies to SMS as well as voice calls. The agent will respond to text messages in the configured language.

### Supported Languages

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **English** | Responds in English (default) |
| **Multilingual** | Detects the language of each incoming message and responds in the same language |
| **French** | Always responds in French |
| **Spanish** | Always responds in Spanish |
| **German** | Always responds in German |

### Multilingual Mode

When set to **Multilingual**, the agent automatically detects what language each incoming text is written in and replies in that same language. This works seamlessly even when the sender switches languages mid-conversation:

```
Visitor: What are your hours?
Agent: We're open Monday-Friday, 9am to 5pm!

Visitor: ¿Tienen servicio los sábados?
Agent: Estamos cerrados los fines de semana, pero puedes dejarnos un mensaje y te responderemos el lunes.

Visitor: Merci, bonne journée!
Agent: Merci à vous aussi, bonne journée !
```

### Configuring Language

1. Open your agent's settings
2. Under **Basic Settings**, select a **Language**
3. The setting applies to both voice calls and SMS — no separate configuration needed

<Note>
The language setting controls the agent's response language. Your system prompt can be written in any language — the agent will follow the language instruction regardless.
