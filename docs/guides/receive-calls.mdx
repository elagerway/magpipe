## Overview

When someone calls your Magpipe number, your AI agent automatically answers and handles the conversation.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Caller Dials Your Number">
    Someone calls the phone number you've provisioned in Magpipe.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Answers">
    Your AI agent picks up and delivers the greeting message you configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conversation">
    The agent responds naturally based on its system prompt and knowledge base.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Ends">
    When the conversation finishes, the call is recorded and transcribed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inbox">
    The call appears in your Inbox with the full recording and transcript.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Capabilities

During a call, your agent can:

### Answer Questions
Using its system prompt and knowledge base to provide accurate information.

### Book Appointments
If Google Calendar is connected, the agent can check availability and schedule appointments.

### Take Messages
Collect information from callers to pass along to you.

### Transfer Calls
Hand off to a human when needed (requires transfer number configuration).

### Provide Information
Share business hours, location, pricing, and other details from its training.

## Call Recording

All calls are recorded by default:
- **Audio recording** - Full call audio
- **Transcript** - AI-generated text transcript
- **Duration** - Call length
- **Timestamp** - When the call occurred

Access recordings in the **Inbox** by clicking on any call.

## After-Hours Calls

When a call comes in outside your agent's scheduled hours, behavior depends on your configuration:

### With Forwarding Number
If you've configured an **After-Hours Call Forwarding** number in your agent's Schedule Settings:
1. The call is routed to your AI agent
2. The agent greets the caller and lets them know it's after hours
3. The agent transfers the call to your forwarding number

### Without Forwarding Number
If no forwarding number is configured:
1. The caller hears: "This Magpipe agent is currently off duty."
2. The call ends

## Agent Schedule

Set business hours for your agent:

1. Open the agent settings
2. Go to **Schedule** tab
3. Configure available hours for each day
4. Set timezone
5. Optionally set an **After-Hours Call Forwarding** number

During scheduled hours, calls are handled normally by the AI agent. Outside scheduled hours, the after-hours behavior above applies.

## Monitoring Calls

View all incoming calls in the **Inbox**:

- Filter by "Calls" to see only voice calls
- Click any call to view transcript and play recording
- See caller ID and call duration
- Check call status and disposition

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep greetings short">
    Callers want to speak, not listen. Keep your greeting under 10 seconds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include key info in system prompt">
    Common questions (hours, location, pricing) should be in the system prompt for quick answers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review transcripts regularly">
    Check transcripts to see what callers are asking, then improve your agent's knowledge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add knowledge sources">
    Link your FAQ and website pages so the agent has more context.
