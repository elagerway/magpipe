## Agent Capabilities

During a call, your agent can:

### Answer Questions
Using its system prompt and knowledge base to provide accurate information.

### Book Appointments
If Google Calendar is connected, the agent can check availability and schedule appointments.

### Take Messages
Collect information from callers to pass along to you.

### Transfer Calls
Hand off to a human when needed (requires transfer number configuration).

### Provide Information
Share business hours, location, pricing, and other details from its training.

## Call Recording

All calls are recorded by default:
- **Audio recording** - Full call audio
- **Transcript** - AI-generated text transcript
- **Duration** - Call length
- **Timestamp** - When the call occurred

Access recordings in the **Inbox** by clicking on any call.

## Voicemail

If your agent is unavailable (outside business hours or system issue), callers can leave a voicemail:

1. Caller reaches voicemail greeting
2. Message is recorded
3. Recording appears in your Inbox
4. You're notified of new voicemail

## Agent Schedule

Set business hours for your agent:

1. Open the agent settings
2. Go to **Schedule** tab
3. Configure available hours for each day
4. Set timezone

Outside scheduled hours:
- Calls go to voicemail
- Custom after-hours message plays

## Monitoring Calls

View all incoming calls in the **Inbox**:

- Filter by "Calls" to see only voice calls
- Click any call to view transcript and play recording
- See caller ID and call duration
- Check if call was answered or went to voicemail
