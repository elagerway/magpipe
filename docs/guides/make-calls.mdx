## Overview

Magpipe supports two types of outbound calls:

1. **Agent Call** - AI agent speaks to the recipient
2. **Callback Call** - You speak to the recipient (bridged through Magpipe)

## Making an Agent Call

Use this when you want your AI agent to call someone on your behalf.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Dialer">
    From the **Home** screen, you'll see the dialpad. Or tap the phone icon in the navigation.

  <Step title="Enter Number">
    Type or paste the phone number you want to call.
