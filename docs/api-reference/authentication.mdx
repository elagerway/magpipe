---

## Overview

Solo Mobile uses Bearer token authentication. You'll need to include your access token in the `Authorization` header of all API requests.

## Getting Your Access Token

### From the Dashboard

1. Log in to [solomobile.ai](https://solomobile.ai)
2. Go to **Settings** → **API**
3. Click **Generate Token**
4. Copy and securely store your token

<Warning>
Treat your API token like a password. Never share it or commit it to source control.
</Warning>

### Programmatically

You can also authenticate using email/password to get a session token:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mtxbiyilvgwhbdptysex.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your@email.com",
    "password": "your-password"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "..."
}
```

## Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://mtxbiyilvgwhbdptysex.supabase.co/functions/v1/endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Token Expiration

- Access tokens expire after 1 hour
- Use the refresh token to get a new access token
- API tokens from the dashboard don't expire (until revoked)

### Refreshing Tokens

```bash
curl -X POST "https://mtxbiyilvgwhbdptysex.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=refresh_token" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "refresh_token": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
  }'
```

## Revoking Tokens

To revoke an API token:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API** in the dashboard
2. Find the token you want to revoke
3. Click **Revoke**

The token will immediately stop working.

    Generate new tokens periodically and revoke old ones.

    Request only the permissions your application needs.
