Looking for these log lines in Render:
1. "Call SID: ..." - to see what call_sid value we're using
2. "Looking up call by call_sid: ..." - confirms first lookup attempt
3. "Looking up call by service_number: ..." - confirms fallback lookup
4. "Found call_record by ..." - to see which method worked

Need to see the full error context to understand which lookup failed.
